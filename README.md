Attendance Management System Using UI/UX

The technical task assigned by “PHISCAPE” for the role of 'UI/UX Designer' is to design and implement a comprehensive 'Attendance Management System'. The technical specifications include separate authentication techniques for admin and employee logins, along with provisions for self-registration. Within the Admin interface, administrators can access employee lists with their pertinent details, attendance records, and leave requests. Admins have the authority to review and manage leave applications by either approving or rejecting them through designated buttons. As for the Employee interface, functionalities for Punch In and Punch Out to record attendance dates and times are included, along with an option to submit leave requests. Employees can also check the status of their submitted leave requests.


For this purpose, I designed a platform adhering to these requirements using the UI/UX feature in Figma. ‘PhiScape.’ is the name of the prototype. In this file, the main page shows the name of the platform and an option button where there are two options for the user to select- Admin or Employee. The user can fill in their username and password and login in. If it is a new user, they can create a new account by clicking on ‘Sign Up here’ and sign in using their newly created credentials. There is also an option to reset the password in case you forgot the password and then log in again using the new password using a verification code. Both the Admin and Employee have the same feature for authentication purpose.


ADMIN INTERFACE :

When the Admin logs in, they are redirected to the Admin Dashboard from the login tab. This tab includes a side menu which are common to all other tabs and it has different options to select from. Using this side panel, we can navigate to other tabs from any tab. The ‘Dashboard’ gives an overview of the system by showing the total count of employees, on-time percentage, late coming count, weekly report of presentees and absentees. From this tab you can navigate to other tabs by utilising the side menu. When you select the ‘Employees’ tab, you get a list of employees registered in this platform along with few of their basic details (for reference, 3 sample employee details are provided). For updation of details, each of the employee’s details can be edited separately by clicking on edit button. This tab gives their basic information, position, joining date. Next from the ‘Attendance’ tab admin can see the check in and check out time of each employee and markings showing who is on-time and who is late and also pie-chart provided to show on-time and late percentage. Next from the ‘Attendance Report’ tab, we can see the leave applications and the status of each including total working days, present days and leaves taken. By clicking on ‘Leave’ button admin goes to ‘Leave Requests’ tab and if an Admin wants to approve or reject a pending application, they can click on the options provided near the corresponding application where they can either reject or approve it by selecting the respective buttons. This updates the status of the application. A ‘Notification’ tab also provided which shows the recent activities. Connections provided to redirect to home i.e., dashboard page or previous pages (for example, at some pages at top right corner back page arrow icon provided to go back to previous pages). Lastly ‘Logout’ button provided which when clicked goes to the main page by logging out the Admin.


EMPLOYEE INTERFACE:

When an Employee logs in, they are redirected to the Employee Dashboard from the login tab. This tab also includes a side menu which are common to all other tabs and has different options to select from. Using this, we can navigate to other tabs from any tab. Similar to the Admin Dashboard, it also gives an overview of the system by showing the total attendance percentage, check-in & check-out button and preview of notification. From this tab we can choose any other tabs we need to access from the side pane. We can view the profile of the employee by clicking on ‘Profile’ icon on the top left corner. time and late percentage. Next from the ‘Leaves’ tab, we can see the pie-chart of leave applications applied containing casual, sick, gifted and remaining leaves and an apply leave button provided to redirect to the leave application submission page. In that page blank buttons provided to answer the reason, type and date taking for leave. Next in ‘Requests’ tab, status of each leave requests whether it is pending or approved is shown. We can also cancel the request by clicking on ‘Cancel Request’ button. A ‘Notification’ tab also provided which shows the recent activities. A ‘Attendance’ tab provided where the user can punch-in or punch-out by recording the corresponding date and time. Connections provided to redirect to home i.e., dashboard page or previous pages (for example, at some pages at top right corner back page arrow icon provided to go back to previous pages). Lastly ‘Logout’ button provided which when clicked goes to the main page by logging out the Employee.


For making the interface more attractive, I have used certain plugins from the Figma community such as Icons8 and IconScout. All the tabs have been connected by using the Figma prototyping tool for flow.
Above mentioned are the features of my attached Figma file.


Kindly go through the prototype I have designed by presenting the link I have mentioned below and check out all the features mentioned.
